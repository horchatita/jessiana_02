# Repository for Assignment 1: Project Proposal

## Introduction to the research question
The research question we will explore is the relationship between the siting of affordable housing communities and their proximity to green spaces and parks in Los Angeles County.

## Why it matters and what’s at stake
It matters because research has shown that low income and marginalized communities often have [limited accessibility](https://usc.data.socrata.com/stories/s/Access-to-Parks-and-Green-Space/uap8-77nz/) to parks and green spaces. However, affordable housing created through Low Income Housing Tax Credits are incentivized to have close proximity to parks and recreational areas. _**There are currently over 6,000 affordable housing projects in Los Angeles County (National Housing Preservation Database); how many of these buildings actually have access to parks and green space?**_

## Spatial and temporal scope
We will be focusing our research on Los Angeles County. We chose to investigate the county as a whole in order to contrast other cities in the county against the City of Los Angeles, in which residents in all areas of the city experience difficulty in accessing parks and outdoor recreational activities within walking distance. 
Los Angeles County is large in size and is composed of a variety of residential geographies: suburbs, desert communities, urban, and coastal cities. These situations create different possibilities for residents in terms of their proximity to parks and green spaces and the quality of those parks and green spaces.

## Description of data sources
- [**National Housing Preservation Database**](https://nhpd.preservationdatabase.org/Data) - *A project of the Public and Affordable Housing Research Corporation (PAHRC) and the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC), this database details “information on contract expiration dates, loan maturity dates, recent physical inspection scores, number of units, type of owner, and other property and subsidy characteristics.” The intention behind this project is to provide communities and professionals in affordable housing the most accurate information about the country’s current affordable housing stock.*

- [**Los Angeles Countywide Parks and Open Space**](https://egis-lacounty.hub.arcgis.com/datasets/countywide-parks-and-open-space-public-hosted/explore?location=33.896012%2C-118.188317%2C11.21&showTable=true) - *This database provides a list of the parks, natural areas and regional open spaces in Los Angeles County. This database was created as part of Los Angeles County’s Parks Needs Assessment and thus, also list the score that each park received. The score will also aid our research in understand the quality of the parks and green spaces near affordable housing communities.*

## Explanation of intended analysis and resulting visualizations
We’d first start off by first defining what accessibility means and identify established metrics around the term, such as distance, walkability, and safety. In our visualization we intend to analyze not only proximity to parks from affordable housing, but also proximity to *high-quality parks.* The LAC Parks and Open Space database includes ratings of park quality and the National Housing Preservation Database includes coordinate data for all affordable housing projects.

## Conclusion about expected research insights
We expect to find that urban parks are less accessible to residents in affordable housing communities and not within walking distance. We also expect to find that high quality parks and green spaces are mainly found in moderate- to high-income neighborhoods. We would like our research to help us better understand and inform the siting patterns of affordable housing projects.
