# Week 04 Update: Exploring Affordable Housing Communities and Park Accessibility Across LA County

[Original Project Proposal](https://github.com/horchatita/206a-project-proposal-jessiana/blob/main/Group%20Assignments/ProjectProposal.md)

## Roles
- Adriana: Repository keeper, coder, public space enthusiast + researcher, meeting facilitator
- Jessica: Coder, data manager, affordable housing specialist, researcher

## Status Update
We acknowledge that we are growing in our coding abilities and processes. We feel more confident than we did in Week 01 and have a much clearer understanding of the story we want to tell with this data. 

_**This is what is working:**_ We are starting to understand what data can we use to visualize spatial patterns (for example, using Census data to make chloropleth maps as opposed to Walkscore data, which does not have geospatial data). We are also mastering different fucntions and commands to achieve our goals. Lastly, the data management component (orginizing files and folders in Github and Jupyter) has made a lot more sense recently.


_**This is what is not working:**_ We are behind in our data collection and figuring out what data we still need. We are hoping to be caught up by the end of this week so that we can finalize our datasets that we will be using.


## Data Update
_**We have this data so far:**_
- [Walkscore LA](https://data.lacounty.gov/Sustainability/Walk-Score-2019-/nnyu-hjy4): Walk Score is a service that grades the “walkability” of select geographies. This dataset includes incorporated and unincorporated cities of Los Angeles County and their respective walk scores.
- [National Housing Preservation Database](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1iwpqgqjlHOY2H8brdg1ad5BNF_5Zn_0w/edit#gid=1976688684): A project of the Public and Affordable Housing Research Corporation (PAHRC) and the National Low Income Housing Coalition (NLIHC), this database details “information on contract expiration dates, loan maturity dates, recent physical inspection scores, number of units, type of owner, and other property and subsidy characteristics.” We are showing this in a Google sheet because the database is restricted to registered users.
- [LA County City Boundaries](https://hub.arcgis.com/datasets/lacounty::la-county-city-boundaries/explore?location=33.784400%2C-118.302300%2C8.55): This file provides city boundaries of cities across LA County.

_**This is the data that we need / want:**_
- Park funding data (we reached out to Dr. Anastasia Loukaitou-Sideris whose expertise is parks and may be able to point us to such data): this data would provide us with an idea of where funding for parks is most invested in LA County and can correlate to park quality. 
- Demographics data: income, race, ethnicity by census tract (from Census Reporter): to understand where affordable housing projects are located and what the demographics look like around those locations. 
- Park boundaries and locations: this data would allow us to assess where parks are located and how approximate they are to affordable housing projects.

## Concerns
We are mainly concerned about being behind in this class and attaining the right data to tell our story.
